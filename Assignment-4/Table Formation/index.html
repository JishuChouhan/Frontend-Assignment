                <p><b>This is my Dream SUV and I,m buying this in just after 5 years.</b>The G-Wagon is an insanely powerful SUV, there is just no other way to say it.The power of the G-Wagon is produced by a <b>handcrafted twin-turbo V8 engine</b> that is signed by the craftsmen themself, creating a monstrous <b>577 HP</b> and <b>627 lb-ft of torque.</b> Reaching <b>60 MPH</b> from a standstill takes only 4.5 seconds for the G63, which is purely insane considering its curb weight of 5,842 lbs. Furthermore, power is sent to all four wheels through a 9-speed automatic gearbox, ensuring that power utilization is not only maximized but harnessed with the greatest degree of control.</p>

                <b>The Bugatti Chiron</b> watch is a limited-edition timepiece made by <b>Jacob & Co.</b>That features a tiny, moving replica of the supercar's <b>16-cylinder engine1234.</b> The watch has other Bugatti-themed elements like a fuel gauge, a grille, and blue shock absorbers1. The price of the watch varies depending on the model and the year. The latest version <b>costs $560,00034,</b> while the previous one was <b>$280,00012.</b>The Chiron watch is the latest creation born from the automotive brand's partnership with Jacob & Co. Last year, Bugatti announced the limited Twin Turbo Furious Bugatti Edition watch, which features a "fuel" indicator and the colors of the French flag on the gauge. That said, it's not quite as cool as wearing a watch with a miniature W-16 engine on board.If someone had to put an engine into a watch, then the Chiron's W-16 is the one to choose. The seven-figure supercar's quad-turbo 8.0-liter 16-cylinder unit makes a breathtaking 1,479 hp and 1,180 lb-ft of torque.

                Watch the video below for a full review of the Bugatti Chiron Tourbillon from TheWatches.tv. The limited-edition watch is customizable, so you can get it in a color to match your Chiron. That said, you don't have to own a Bugatti to get the watch.</p>
